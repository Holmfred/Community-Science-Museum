                        explores the night sky and what we can see and know about the universe around us.
                        We’ll locate the various constellations and galaxies that can be seen and learn a bit
                        about the early navigators who used the stars to travel by.
                    </p>

                        to Galileo’s telescope, to the latest exploration of the planets in our solar system.

                    <p>For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the 
                        question of our origins. Where do we come from and how did we get here?
                        Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a framework for 
                        exploring and understanding our place in this world.
                    </p>   
                    <p>Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we know today have
                        evolved our time. You can also take some time to meet a few of the creatures 
                        who didn’t survive, including our Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, 
                        and a number of dinosaurs too.

                    <p>From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs
                        in biology are offering us unique insights into the great wonders of the tiny world.
                    </p>  
                    <p>For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their
                        quality of life much improved, thanks to the growth of our understanding of medicine. 
                        Over a series of exhibits we explore the history of medicine and take a look at
                        some major breakthroughs including the discovery of penicillin
                        and the first heart transplant. 
                    </p> 
                    <p>Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the lab,
                        but also from observing animals in the wild. Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.

                    <p>As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the planet, 
                        the more important it becomes that scientists explore how to create 
                        a sustainable future not just for humans but for the whole planet.

                    <p>In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the dangers we currently 
                        face including global warming, extinction of species, and pollution. 
                        But we also focus on the positive ways we can all contribute to a brighter future.
