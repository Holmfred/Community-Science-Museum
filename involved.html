            <h2>Support</h2>
            <p>There are various ways you can support the museum. Donations are very welcome and 
                are an important way we keep this museum open and accessible to the whole community. 
            
                You can also support us by donating items of interest to the museum’s collections. 
                If you have some item or collection that you think others would enjoy, please let us know 
                by contacting our Collections Department and they will be able to assist you.

            <h2>Volunteer</h2>
            <p>A number of people volunteer their time and effort to keep the displays in good order 
                and ready for visitors to come and enjoy. Volunteering has its perks including getting to 
                see behind the scenes of a working museum, access to staff-only lectures, and a monthly 
                lunch where all staff and volunteers come together to discuss ideas for future exhibits and 
                strategies for the museum.

                You can help volunteer in a number of different spheres. Please contact us if you’d like to 
                find out more about how you can get involved.

            <h2>Internships</h2>
            <p>Are you interested in working in a museum? Do you enjoy the fun and excitement of sharing 
                the wonders of nature with people? Well you could be just the right person to enjoy an 
                internship at the museum.

                You’ll be learning from a number of different academics and people who are passionate 
                about science and sharing it with the wider community.
