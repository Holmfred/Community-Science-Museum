                        and ready for visitors to come and enjoy. Volunteering has its perks including getting to 
                        see behind the scenes of a working museum, access to staff-only lectures, and a monthly 
                        lunch where all staff and volunteers come together to discuss ideas for future exhibits and 
                        strategies for the museum.
                    </p>
                    <p>You can help volunteer in a number of different spheres. Please contact us if you’d like to 
                        find out more about how you can get involved.
